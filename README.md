# NST_Augmentation
This project focuses on enhancing Breast Ultrasound (BUS) image datasets using Neural Style Transfer (NST) integrated with Explainable AI (XAI) techniques. The aim is to improve the quality, diversity, and interpretability of stylized augmented images. We employ Parallel Computing using the Horovod framework to accelerate the augmentation process.

To evaluate the effectiveness of our augmentation strategy, we classify both the original and the augmented datasets using a fine-tuned ResNet50 model.
## ðŸš€ Features
ðŸ“¸ Advanced Image Augmentation: Leverages Neural Style Transfer (NST) to enhance Breast Ultrasound (BUS) image diversity and quality, addressing overfitting in deep learning models.

ðŸŽ¨ Hybrid NST Architecture: Combines Demystifying NST (DNST) and mr2NST models with a pre-trained ResNet50 to design a novel and effective style loss function.

ðŸ§  Explainable AI with LRP: Integrates Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) to highlight important features in content images, enhancing transparency and model interpretability.

âš¡ Parallelized Training with Horovod: Utilizes Horovod for distributed deep learning, scaling across 8 GPUs for efficient NST training.

ðŸ“Š Performance Evaluation: Assesses augmentation quality by training a fine-tuned ResNet50 classifier, showing a significant accuracy boost (from ~56% to 99.70%).
